# Operational Risk KPI Dashboard  

## Overview  
This project demonstrates how **operational risk data** can be transformed into actionable insights using data visualization. The goal was to design a **KPI dashboard** that tracks incidents by department, root cause, and severity to help organizations **monitor risks, identify trends, and improve decision-making**.  

The dashboard was built in **Power BI** using a synthetic dataset, showcasing data modeling, KPI tracking, and automation features.

## Project Files  
- `Operational Risk KPI Dashboard.pdf` – Export of the final dashboard.  
- `Operational_Risk_KPI_Dashboard_Dataset.csv` – Synthetic dataset used for analysis.

## Tech Stack  
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI  
- **Data Preparation:** Excel  
- **Dataset:** Synthetic operational risk incidents (50+ records across multiple departments)  

---

##  Features  
- Tracked **50+ operational risk incidents** categorized by department, root cause, and severity.  
- Designed **KPI cards** for high-level monitoring of incident frequency and severity.  
- Created **interactive drilldowns** to filter by department and root cause.  
- Added **trend analysis visuals** to highlight patterns in incident reporting.  
- Proposed **automation rules** for monitoring recurring risks.  

---

##  Key Insights  
- Risk incidents often cluster around specific root causes, providing opportunities for targeted process improvements.  
- Visual KPIs allow faster detection of high-severity incidents and their departmental impact.  
- Trend analysis helps management **prioritize mitigation strategies**.  

---

##  Future Improvements  
- Integrate with live data sources (SQL/Azure).  
- Expand dataset to include financial impact of incidents.  
- Automate reporting with scheduled refreshes in Power BI Service.
